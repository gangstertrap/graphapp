# graphapp
Written with Java 11 and Javafx 11.0.2. needs javafx to compile.
Very messy and really just to practice making stuff again.
I will likely revisit this in the future but in the form of just remaking it.

Make graphs by adding vertices and edges between them, enable weighted or directed graphs, move vertices around and delete them, zoom in or out and pan around, etc.
